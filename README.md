# The Knowledge Vault
## Introduction
Welcome to the TUM Blockchain Club Knowleddge Vault - the space where we collectively gather all our knowledge in the space of Distributed System, Blockchain, Distributed Ledger Technologies and many more topics. 

This project is a collaborativ effort to gather useful information and educational material. We do not gurantee the correctness of any knowledge in this vault, however the knowledge base ist strictly maintained and we strive for delivering high quality and correct content.

**The Technical University Munich is not affiliated with any of the content found in this vault. All content in this vault is of our own creation and a collection of the things we've learned and researched.**

If you find that parts of this vault are incomplete or incorrect, then please check out the [Contributing](#Contributing) section of this document, to open an issue. We're always happy about new contributions.

## How to use
### Cloning the Vault
To use the knowledge vault, simply clone it into your preffered directory using git: 

```console
git clone https://github.com/TUM-Blockchain-Club/TBC-Knowledge-Vault.git <Directory>
```

### Obsidian.md
[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is a knowledge base tool that manages knowledge as a vault (Directories) of Markkdown files. It is a community driven platform which is highly customisable to your needs. There are many [community plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins), [different themes and configurations](https://github.com/kmaasrud/awesome-obsidian) to make you comfortable managing all your knowledge. 

We've decided to go with obsidian for our knowledeg base, because it gives us the freedom of managing our data independently of the software itself. 

To browse the TBC Knowledge Vault, dowload obsidian and simply open the directory you've cloned in [Cloning the Vault](#Cloning the Vault).

If you're new to obsidian, you can use our [Obsidian Configuration](./Obsidian_Configuration.md) as a guide to get started with some use full plugins. 

### Website
We're planning to host the TBC Knowldege Vault as a webiste at some point in the future. Stay tuned for more!
